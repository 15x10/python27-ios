# -*- makefile -*-
# The file Setup is used by the makesetup script to construct the files
# Makefile and config.c, from Makefile.pre and config.c.in,
# respectively.  The file Setup itself is initially copied from
# Setup.dist; once it exists it will not be overwritten, so you can edit
# Setup to your heart's content.  Note that Makefile.pre is created
# from Makefile.pre.in by the toplevel configure script.

# (VPATH notes: Setup and Makefile.pre are in the build directory, as
# are Makefile and config.c; the *.in and *.dist files are in the source
# directory.)

# Each line in this file describes one or more optional modules.
# Modules enabled here will not be compiled by the setup.py script,
# so the file can be used to override setup.py's behavior.

# Lines have the following structure:
#
# <module> ... [<sourcefile> ...] [<cpparg> ...] [<library> ...]
#
# <sourcefile> is anything ending in .c (.C, .cc, .c++ are C++ files)
# <cpparg> is anything starting with -I, -D, -U or -C
# <library> is anything ending in .a or beginning with -l or -L
# <module> is anything else but should be a valid Python
# identifier (letters, digits, underscores, beginning with non-digit)
#
# (As the makesetup script changes, it may recognize some other
# arguments as well, e.g. *.so and *.sl as libraries.  See the big
# case statement in the makesetup script.)
#
# Lines can also have the form
#
# <name> = <value>
#
# which defines a Make variable definition inserted into Makefile.in
#
# Finally, if a line contains just the word "*shared*" (without the
# quotes but with the stars), then the following modules will not be
# built statically.  The build process works like this:
#
# 1. Build all modules that are declared as static in Modules/Setup,
#    combine them into libpythonxy.a, combine that into python.
# 2. Build all modules that are listed as shared in Modules/Setup.
# 3. Invoke setup.py. That builds all modules that
#    a) are not builtin, and
#    b) are not listed in Modules/Setup, and
#    c) can be build on the target
#
# Therefore, modules declared to be shared will not be
# included in the config.c file, nor in the list of objects to be
# added to the library archive, and their linker options won't be
# added to the linker options. Rules to create their .o files and
# their shared libraries will still be added to the Makefile, and
# their names will be collected in the Make variable SHAREDMODS.  This
# is used to build modules as shared libraries.  (They can be
# installed using "make sharedinstall", which is implied by the
# toplevel "make install" target.)  (For compatibility,
# *noconfig* has the same effect as *shared*.)
#
# In addition, *static* explicitly declares the following modules to
# be static.  Lines containing "*static*" and "*shared*" may thus
# alternate throughout this file.

# NOTE: As a standard policy, as many modules as can be supported by a
# platform should be present.  The distribution comes with all modules
# enabled that are supported by most platforms and don't require you
# to ftp sources from elsewhere.

# The modules listed here can't be built as shared libraries for
# various reasons; therefore they are listed here instead of in the
# normal order.

# This only contains the minimal set of modules required to run the 
# setup.py script in the root of the Python source tree.

errno errnomodule.c		# posix (UNIX) errno values

# The zipimport module is always imported at startup. Having it as a
# builtin module avoids some bootstrapping problems and reduces overhead.

# The rest of the modules listed in this file are all commented out by
# default.  Usually they can be detected and built as dynamically
# loaded modules by the new setup.py script added in Python 2.1.  If
# you're on a platform that doesn't support dynamic loading, want to 
# compile modules statically into the Python binary, or need to 
# specify some odd set of compiler switches, you can uncomment the 
# appropriate lines below.
